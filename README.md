# Data_Business_Valuation
Information located in different parts of organizations is presumed to be of immense value, but there is currently no generally accepted approach to objectively measure as a financial asset. Knowing the actual value of information assets within an organization can lead to a better understanding of the more valuable and less valuable information. This in turn can lead to better decision making in terms of IT investment and strategy.

This ![proposal](31776-9933411_055_solution.pdf) is the winning submission of an [Innocentive Crowdsourcing Ideation Challenge (ID# 9933411)][innocentive-challenge] related to establishing a business valuation of data. It offers an approach which is both practical to apply and consistent with accepted accounting principles.
